# foxreplacements

This file can be imported into FoxReplace to do the fun word substitutions from http://xkcd.com/1288/ and http://xkcd.com/1625/, plus a few others.

Replaced words show in italics, and the original is shown if you hover.

You can also change the value of "-workdomain.com" in the URLs to ignore substitution on your work website.
